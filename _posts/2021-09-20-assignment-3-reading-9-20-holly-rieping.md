In her “Enhanced Critical Curation” section of _DigitalHumanities_, Anne Burdick provides the historical context for archive curation and explains the changes curation has had to undergo in the digital age. I found her analogy of “poetic composition as a compression algorithm and audience reception as a decompression tool” particularly compelling in the explanation that curated archives don’t give us every material available, but they give us a selection of materials that we can then formulate a story out of. As we’ve become more digital, Burdick explains that critical curation is an essential practice because of the overwhelming abundance of materials available to archives. So, similar to poetic composition, we must pick what has the most value and present it in a way that provides our audience with the best story. 

In her “The Animated Archive” section of _DigitalHumanities_, Burdick explains that the “animation” of archives aims to bring users to the center of the archive and give them the power to curate, process, and create content as individuals and as communities. She presents the idea that all public institutions have become “glocal enterprises”, both global and local, and as such, the traditional roles of archivists, curators, scholars, etc. must shift in order to include users and communities and tell the stories they want to tell in new, imaginative ways. Rather than the one-way traditional sense of users coming to an archive for information, there must be a two-way flow of knowledge and curation between professionals and institutions and users and communities.
