In "The Future of Archives is Participatory: Archives as Platform, or A New Mission for Archives," author and archivist Kate Theimer writes that the criteria for participatory archives are: engagement, the ability to make new or personal contributions, the ability to add information which draws upon personal knowledge or experience, and the ability to connect people to an experience larger than themselves. I was most inspired by Theimer's last point on "the need for self-transcendence, or furthering a cause beyond the self." This is not something I have been able to name before, but I think is a primary motivation for my own personal interest in building active archives. I am most interested in archiving the present to connect it with archives of the past and inform people of the near future. All of this is rooted in a longing for inter-generational connections where knowledge is shared in all directions. This in essence, is a goal much larger than any one archive itself. And for this goal to be achieved, the archive must be participatory.
