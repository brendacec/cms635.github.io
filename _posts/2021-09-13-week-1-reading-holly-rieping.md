In her talk/blog post _The Future of Archives is Participatory: Archives as Platform, or A New Mission for Archives_ Kate Theimer discusses changes in the “business model” of archives as we shift from physical, traditional archives to more digital and participatory ones. She first explains how old model archives had a sort of monopoly on their archival material and that only the specific people who needed to find that material, such as scholars or other archivists, would be catered to by the archive. In the participatory archive, the monopoly is no longer there as more participating users provide an abundance rather than scarcity of material and more users outside of the scholarly realm must be catered to by the archive. 

In order to make this business model shift, Theimer proposes a new mission for archives to, “...add value to people’s lives by increasing their understanding and appreciation of the past” (Theimer, 4). Rather than putting the archival materials at the core of the archive’s mission, Theimer places the people and users at the center. She wants to change the marketing of archives such that people don’t associate them with old, outdated, dusty establishments, but places where they can learn and contribute to their communities. She suggests that this shift could help people connect with and be part of something larger than themselves, and truly add value to their lives.

In his article _Participatory Archive: Towards Decentralized Curation, Radical User Orientation, and Broader Contextualisation of Records Managerment_, Isto Huivila gives three core principles for participatory archives: decentralized curation, radical user orientation, and contextualization of both records and the entire archival process. He defines “decentralized curation” as sharing curation responsibilities between archivists and archive participants. He defines “radical user orientation” as orienting and reorienting the archive to its users/participants all the time. He defines “contextualisation of both records and the entire archival process” as expanding the contexts in an archive to include the archive, archivists, and participants themselves.

He uses Yakel, Shaw, and Reynolds’ discussion of a digitized version of the Polar Bear Expedition archives as an example of a participatory archive that is based on comments, bookmarking, and visitor awareness. This uses some decentralized curation and deeper contextualization, yet is not as radical in its orientation since the user interaction is kept separate from the archival records themselves. He uses the model from Shilton and Srinivasan to show decentralized curation through a chosen community providing resources for the archive, yet still suggests that this doesn’t fully fulfil the racial user orientation requirement. He then discusses the issues of trustworthiness and value in a participatory archive, but remains hopeful for the future of participatory archives.
