In his article _Archive_, Mike Featherstone discusses the origin of archives as government institutions and the shift of archives to a more public role over time. I found his explanations of the role archives played in colonialization, governance, and creating a common identity for a people especially compelling. We typically hear the phrase “history is written by the victors”, but it was interesting seeing that contextualized to include archives as well and how they not only preserve and tell history, but they help shape the identities of people and cultures as a whole. I also found his specific examples on how archives were affected by colonialization, like how the Cuban archive is in Madrid or how the British archives pirated material from Indian archives, very compelling in the idea that censorship, surveillance, and overall power play a huge role in what stories are told and where. 

His argument for the future of archives seemed to be centered on the idea of decentralizing archives. He suggests that technology and the wide-spread access to materials may allow people to record or discover their own identities in ways that weren’t previously possible under the traditional, elitist approach. Under this approach, more material is given value and more stories are told, yet the way to organize something this large hasn’t been perfected yet. I found his concept of this decentralized approach that values individuals as much as if not more than the institution very compelling and that it makes sense in the digital age.
