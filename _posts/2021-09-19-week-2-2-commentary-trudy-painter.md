In Digital Humanities by Anne Burdick, we cover 2 sections, [1] "Enhanced Critical Curation" and [2] "The Animated Archive."

In "Enhanced Critical Curation," Burdick expands upon similar ideas we have already been reading about in class. Archiving is no longer limited by physical constraints. And instead, we now have an abundace of archival material that can turn into "data trash" if not presently effectively. Burdick calls for curators to "filter, organize, craft, and, ultimately, care for a story...re-presenting the cultural record of humankind in order to create value, impact, and quality." Essentially, curators can control the story of the material they are working with by intentional selection and presentation that paints a picture of the setting that they are representing. 

In "The Animated Archive," Burdick again explores the notion that "Accumulation is no longer enough to ensure the survival of the cultural patrimony." This is a great point that has been reiterated over all of the readings. Burdick calls for innovative shifts in presentation of archival material. The "animation" of the archive is the strategy of launching the afterlife of the archival material through metadata, tagging, and open source software for processing. She also highlights the fact that instituions' virtual footprints are starting to exceed their physical ones. Globalization isn't slowing down, and Burdick suggests that institutions focus more energy on engaging their virtual audiences with their digital content.
