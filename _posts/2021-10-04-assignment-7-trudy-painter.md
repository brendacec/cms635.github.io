Lawrence Liang's "THE DOMINANT, THE RESIDUAL, AND THE EMERGENT IN ARCHIVAL IMAGINATION"  felt like one of the artiest articles we have read so far. It was littered with references to art critics, films, and niche scholars that took a lot of Google searches to fully grasp.

He begins by discussing how dust has played a role in archival research. People in the old days literally died from too much archiving (and sniffing the dust off the archival material). This leads into Liang's major question of how we choose what to discard. The archivists who risked their life were trying to preserve material that was deemed to be unimportant by existing power structures. Liang presents the example of Muttiah Chettiar who was eventually paid (postmortem) for his collection of hundreds of thousands of Indian historical items.

Liang then discusses how documentaries are aggregations of mundane yet humanizing images. He cites how "Los Angeles Plays Itself" is an effective narration of LA, composed of unused film material and describes them as "valuable images not for what they sought to capture but of what they happened to capture." He then trudges into territory pondering time and the ephemeral unraveling of film within the realm of the contingent. How can we capture the chance of moving images in an archive that is meant to freeze time? He concludes by saying we must actually watch the archival films to benefit from them, citing Henry Langois "films are like Persian carpets, they have to be walked on."

My takeaway is that ror the Black Oral History archive, we need to make sure that MIT's Black voices live on by being ACTUALLY listened to. We can incorporate features that encourage sitting with the intimacy of people's voices and conversation and shift away from metadata and descriptions as main points of learning for the audience.
