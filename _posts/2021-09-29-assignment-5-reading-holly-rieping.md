In chapter 3 “Underway to the Dual System: Classical Archives and Digital Memory” in his book _Digital Memory_ and the Archive, Wolfgang Ernst explores the shift to digital archives and what paradigm and definition shifts must accompany it. Instead of exploring the digital archive as a sort of backup for a physical archive, he defines the “dynarchive” as a “user-oriented” archive that uses a “generative, participative form of archival reading” (82). I found his argument that the Internet is not an archive, when we take away all the connotations we’ve added to the word “archive”, but a computer itself is very intriguing. I also found his take on the “medium is the message” in regards to the format of digital media interesting especially in our project where we need to consider how much we can edit or alter the media when presenting it and still preserve the context and overall message.

In chapter 4, “Archives in Transition: Dynamic Media Memories”, Ernst explains new, technically-based analogies for archival processes and elements in a digital archive. Along with this, he redefines “memory” to refer to a computer’s memory in that it is used for computation, performance, and communication rather than as a cultural record in a traditional archival sense. Further, he introduces the concept of “timeshifting”, saying that the digital memory, since it is constantly accessed and modified, is not clearly defined in the past or present as a traditional archive would be. Finally, he argues that while, “In our brain there is nothing comparable to an archive”, he finds that digital memory, “...turns out to be closer to human neuronal memory than to cultural memory agencies” (101). In our project, because we want to allow people to have a journey or create their own experiences based on associations their minds make, the digital archive and the digital memory would allow us to more closely replicate the brain’s associations and natural paths of thought.
