In "Archive," sociologist Mike Featherstone opens with history of the archive. He discusses how institutions were limited by physical resources, housing locations, and funding. Archives also served a different purpose than just the information gathering we are familiar with today. The archives proved validity of nations by fostering and transcribing national history. However, there has been recent shift to digital archives. Featherstone explores future challenges of digital archvies and provides advice on how to reframe thinking about them.

The advent of new technolgies in theory allows for unlimited collection and access of archival material. This should be great, right? Not necessarily. Featherstone provides annecdotes about why limitless archiving is not the best approach. For example, he references short stories from Borges that explore concepts of infinity and the dangers of limitlessness, like "Library of Babel" and "Funes, his Memory." And, in regards to digital archives, Featherstone describes the accumulation of archived materials as "a cancer culture." Archives no longer face the issue of physical constraints. Instead, they face the opposite issue. Due to the free flowing nature of digital archives, Featherstone describes the following

>  Rather the decentralized digital archive takes the form of a database in which, depending on the access coding, knowledge becomes freer to flow through decentred networks. The danger is that their knowledge will no longer be contained in a singular system in which all the elements are articulated into a unified corpus. The danger is of unperceived degradation – that what has been referred to as ‘a cancer culture’ will develop within the digital archive, as dissociated cellular elements are re-associated into linear distributions and one cell’s identifying code is transcribed into others in a generative chain (Lynch, 1999).

Featherstone makes effective points that we should shift our idea of what an archive should be. Archivists should adapt to new technologies and find more fluid, dynamic ways to categorize the plethora of diverse information available.
