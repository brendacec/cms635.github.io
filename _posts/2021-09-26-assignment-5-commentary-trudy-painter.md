Ernst's "Classical Archives and Digital Memory" takes the most mathematical approach to archiving we have read so far. Honestly, this was a tough reading for me to get through. I sometimes got lost in the type of digital archving he was arguing for. However, I did finish with a couple major takeaways/perspective shifts.

[1] Born digital media are always shifting processually; they do not exist as fixed data blocks. Take the example of a printed encyclopedia versus Wikipedia. A printed encyclopedia exsits as an ultimate repository of static information. However, Wikipedia is constantly growing with dynamic entries. This idea of ever-shifting information feeds into the next point I took away.

[2] The new archive's job will be to meaningfully link different information nodes mathematically. Archives no longer serve the purpose of reactivating archivalia, instead they are meant to reactivate the relations between the archivalia. Therefore, we can leverage algorithms to categorize and index digital art/media more flexibly.

In regards to the MIT Black History project, I think we should focus on how connecting relations between nodes and stories. We can hone in on common themes and use relationship building to tell a better story about the Black experience at MIT.
