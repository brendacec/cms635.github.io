In “Dealing with the silence,” Valerie Johnson offers solutions for the gaps left in archival history involving recovery of documentation, whether from the original source or an alternative source, or by highlighting the silence in existing archives. She warns about looking for history that doesn’t exist, and discusses the evolution of heritage through the pieces that do exist. She also mentions that interaction with the archive can destroy its value and heritage. I didn’t quite follow the next discussion about remembering and forgetting- I don’t understand whether Johnson was claiming that less significance be placed on items of the past, and instead how they contributed to today, or if it was a discussion intended to relieve the stress of completing the impossible task of archiving everything. There’s parts in her discussion that I agree with, but I felt it was a strange shift from attempting to locate the silenced voices, to letting the past be the past. It felt somewhat discouraging to me.

She discusses the idea of ‘sense-making’ which allows the user interacting with the archive to come to their own conclusions from both the scraps saved and lost. I enjoy this idea a lot, and (like we have discussed) I feel that some aspects of our project should allow the user to build their own understanding rather than following a fixed path. However, the user might not be able to identify where the ‘silence’ is in the archive if they are not already somewhat knowledgeable of the subject. I almost feel like there should be a disclaimer on the information in the archive mentioning its incompleteness (although implied) and there should be attempts to highlight the gaps in information, just so the user really knows. 

I wonder if information external to MIT should be applied to the project as well, like some description of the social and political climate off campus. Many people who are not personally impacted by these parts of history are prone to forget important how far various movements or attitudes have shifted (in theory) and just how recent these events took place. I hope that our archive can provide a wider context to MIT at these points of time (and today), further explaining the ‘silencing’ of the voices in our archive, and providing another reason for why creating a complete archive is an impossible task.
