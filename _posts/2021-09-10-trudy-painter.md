[Trudy Painter](www.trudy.computer) is a 3rd year undergrad at MIT double majoring in computer science and comparative media studies. Sheâ€™s interested in exploring data with code, building systems from scratch, and quantifying effects of media. You can see an example of her experimentation with collecting and visualizing her Spotify listening history [here](http://trudy.tube/). Also, check out her [Are.na](https://www.are.na/trudy-painter) which is full of collections of her other interests.
