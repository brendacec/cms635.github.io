I want to present recordings from the archive in such a way that provides the listener with relevant context to aid the experience of listening to the material and encourages the audience to continue exploring the archive and make connections between different pieces of information. The audience would consist of those interested in exploring history and the experiences of past (and present) figures, however ideally the general public should be able to interact with the material in a way that might stimulate interest deeper than surface level. 

A general audience may find difficulty in following recordings, especially if they are long, or fail to catch their interest in the first few seconds. By adding some visual material of the speaker talking, or the subject of interest in the recording, the listener now has something visual to connect the sound to.

Ideally, there would be similar or suggested recordings to listen to next, based on topics within the original recording. The audience would then be able to continue in a way that caters to their interest, but still guided (by the suggestions) in their exploration of the Black experience. Suggestions including the speaker should be included, in the case the listener is attracted to that particular voice, or if they found that particular delivery much easier to follow than others.

For a more immersive experience, a user might be able to just click on an interesting topic, then explore an accompanying virtual landscape with similar elements as described above. The only difference is that this path of exploration is already created based on the topic. The user might be able to simply scroll down to explore, taking the stress of decision making away for that particular topic.

In addition, the user might be able to create their own immersive collection of pictures, information that can go with the recordings, or organize it in a way that they personally enjoy. These collections should be able to be shared amongst the audience themselves, so that there are many more ‘decided’ paths to explore and the takeaways of the community itself can be explored.
