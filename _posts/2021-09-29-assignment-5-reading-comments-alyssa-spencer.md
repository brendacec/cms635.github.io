Ernst’s “Underway to the Dual System” really made me reconsider how I think of a digital archive. I like the distinction of an archive for memory and cultural memory and an archive that is used as an agency for memory technology. I understood it almost like a unique label or call given to the piece of information to be archived. I think he implies later that it is embedded in that ‘label.’ 

I’m not quite sure I followed with the math and the associated archiving. It reminds me of set theory to an extent, probably because that has been in the back of my mind and also because the way I understood it, the generated reference has connections and links to other related pieces of information embedded. 

I’m not sure I understood everything, but basically what I gathered was that the digital archive should be considered as the call to memory, or retrieval of information instead of the information itself.
