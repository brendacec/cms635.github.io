Valerie Johnson's "Dealing with the silence" examines multiple ways to fill the silence:

1. Allow silent voices to speak. This is a nuanced topic, but the power of the archive is in the interpretation of the audience. The silencing of one voice in a narrative will not silence their entire story because other voice can come forward to speak and paint the picture of the social/political context.
- If there is a voice that we know has been silenced (and we do not have records of), we could include ample documents for the audience to piece together the context for the story of the silenced voice.

2. Find alternative voices. For example, if one country's government don't exist for a certain event, check another country's records. 
- We can implement records from other schools covering events that correlate to a given story/interview.

3. Read voices back into the past. For example, in literature, give powerful voices to previously silenced voices (ie women/minorities).
- This doesn't directly apply to the Black Oral History Project (because we are focusing on real/nonfiction accounts). However, if we are ever painting a picture or providing context for another story, we can make sure that we are characterizing ALL voices (ie women/people with disabilites)

4. Design systmes where more voices are represented in the future. Consider the shift in museums. Museums used to exist as a hegemonic entity for rich white men to view art that refelcted their lifestyle. However, now musuems are platforms for social activism through art by showcasing previously underrepresented voies.
- We can provide resources for ways that Black students can contribute their experience to the overall MIT archives. The MIT Black Oral History Project is already telling the story of a historically marginalized group, and we want to ensure this story is represented in more mainstream places as well.

Johnson presents all of these ideas with one caveat though. There will always be self-selecting material that does not survive. She often puts this in conversation with "heritage." And, we shouldn't think of the discarded material as lost, rather re-created in a dynamic representation of the authentic heritage/culture being represented. We can keep this in mind with the MIT Black Oral History Project. In the case of oral stories being passed down, the core parts of the story are preserved with surrounding details occasionally being messed up. We can keep this in mind when designing our website and focus on preserving core themes while letting go of insignificant details.
