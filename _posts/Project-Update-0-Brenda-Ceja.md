# Project Ideation - Brenda Ceja

### - What is the issue, aspect that you would like to address?

I am interested in designing tweaks to the MIT Black Experience Archive to address current areas of improvement for the website. For example, adding a search bar to every entry page for easier search navigation; allowing users to navigate left and right to related or "next" entries for a given keyword or person in the archive; creating biography pages that contain bidirectional links to the entry in which the person is named.  
### - Who is the audience for your project?

The audience for my project is the general public, and more specifically, student researchers. 
### - How does your envisioned audience benefit from your approach?

In an ideal world, if I viewed [this entry](https://www.blackhistory.mit.edu/archive/w-ahmad-salih-1972) and wanted to learn more about Waayl Ahmad Salih, all I would have to do would click his name to be brought to a biography page which would give me basic information about him, and show other entries he is tagged or feature in. Currently, I would have to copy his name, backtrack to the search page (since there is not a search bar on every page), and paste his name into the search bar to piece together the entries about him. I would then have to individually click on each entry in new tabs since I cannot navigate back and forth among them. 

The general public and student researchers would benefit from the increased ease of navigation in my approach. It would allow viewers to more easily learn about certain alumni without needing to open multiple tabs at once from the search page. 

### - What is the level and kind of participation by your audience?

The level of participation from my audience ranges from surface-level preliminary searches to in-depth research. The participation is outlined partially above, but in summary, would be engaged and able to continue moving forward without having to resort back to the main search page to reset their searches. 

### - How do you envision to achieve this goal?

I envision to achieve this goal by designing mockups in Figma. I may also use Roam Research to model what bidirectional links in the biography might look like for the archive.
