Here's a link to my API exercise: [https://editor.p5js.org/calianne99/sketches/25vIXQUsO](https://editor.p5js.org/calianne99/sketches/25vIXQUsO)

I've had previous experience with APIs and REST APIs, but not that much experience with javascript, so it was fun getting to play around with the visualization. I worked off of the histogram starter code and added some mouseover labels. It's not as pretty as I'd like it to be right now, but some tweaking would get it there.
