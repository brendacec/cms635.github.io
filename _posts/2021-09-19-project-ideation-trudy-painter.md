### What is the issue, aspect that you would like to address?
I want to address how to display audio with intuitive design that allows for exploration based on metadata tagging.

### Who is the audience for your project?
Ideally the general public. I think accessibility should be prioritized. 

### How does your envisioned audience benefit from your approach?
I want any listener to be able to get lost in the audio snippets. 

### What is the level and kind of participation by your audience?
The audience shouldn't necessarily be the main contributor. I want the audience to primarily consume and focus on listening to others' experiences.

### How do you envision to achieve this goal?
Below is a mockup of how I think that tagging of metadata could be used to explore different audio snippets from the interview described in class.
