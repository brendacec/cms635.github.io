Kate Theimer's talk-turned-blog-post begins by walking readers through the modernization of archives. She has three main points about modern archives that flow into each other. First, she discusses how the business model for archived material has shifted from scarcity to abundance. Because of the internet, the general public has access to unlimited information. This concept bleeds into Theimer's second point; archives are no longer about physical materials and providing passive access. Archives need to start actively marketing themselves towards users to make the general public interested in them. This brings Theimer to her third point. Archivists need to change how the public views archives. Archives need to follow in libraries' footsteps by rebranding as a community-centered place for fun. And, they can do that by making archives participatory and engaging.

Theimer brings up multiple levels of making archives feel more friendly. At one of the lowest levels, she suggests integrating archival content into social media feeds like Twitter and Pinterest. Users don't have to go anywhere different to be exposed to archival content. However, this is still just consumption. Theimer then suggests more advanced ways users can actively contribute to the archives in increasing levels of involvement. First, she discusses finding ways to enable anyone in the community to contribute to an archive, like NYC menu transcription. Then, she suggests utilizing community members' knowledge bases. For example, she suggests asking people to identify subjects in a picture. And finally, she discusses larger contributions like scanning objects from personal collections or assisting in managerial roles. Finally, Theimer concludes with an optimistic outlook for the future of modern archives. Participatory archives break down their old, dusty stereotype by enabling users to engage directly with meangingful content larger than themselves.
